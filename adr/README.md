# Architecture decision records

Why art-crit is built the way it is. Each record covers one decision, the alternatives that were turned
down, and what the decision costs.

This folder sits at the repo root and not under `docs/`, because everything in `docs/` is published to
GitHub Pages.

## How these docs fit together

- **SPEC.md**: the contract. It says *what* the system does.
- **adr/**: *why* it does it that way.
- **AGENTS.md**: how to work in the repo, plus the gotchas.

Gotchas (Playwright sleep, `append(null)`, Safari Range requests...) aren't decisions, so they stay in AGENTS.md.

## Writing one

Copy `template.md` to `NNNN-short-title.md` using the next number, and add it to the index below.

- A record's status is Proposed, Accepted, Superseded by NNNN, or Deprecated.
- Don't rewrite an accepted record when the decision changes. Write a new one and mark the old one superseded.
  Small factual updates, such as a renamed file, are fine.
- If a record backs a rule in AGENTS.md, point to it from that rule, like "(ADR-0004)".
